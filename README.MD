# Paw Hunt

## Description
A game for my 2 year old son to play with his favorite animals. The game is a simple hide and seek game where the animal is hidden and goes to a random location on the screen. The player then has to find the animal by clicking on it. The game is designed to be simple and easy to play for a 2 year old.
